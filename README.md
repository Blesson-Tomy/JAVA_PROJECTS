# JAVA_PROJECTS
This is a simple folder for the Java language projects that I will be attempting. Feel free to suggest new projects or improvements for my existing projects!
Currently, there are 2 Projects:
  1) A Simple Java Calculator
  2) A Simple Number Guessing Game

<h2>Calculator</h2>
Simply run the program and select which operation needs to be carried out. 
Enter the operands and receive your answer.

<h2>Number_Guessing_Game</h2>
This is a game where the user has to guess the number selected by the computer.
Simply run the program and follow the instructions.
